# Root Component (`App.vue`)

## Overview
This is the root component of your Vue.js application. It serves as the main container for your entire application and is used by both the client-side (`main.ts`) and server-side (`entry-server.ts`) entry points.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Template Section
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello from SSR Vue 3 + Vite!</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```
- The `<template>` section defines the HTML structure of your component
- Contains a simple welcome message
- The root `<div>` element is a common Vue.js pattern for having a single root element
- This HTML will be rendered on both server and client

### 2. Script Section
```vue
<script lang="ts">
export default {
  name: 'App'
};
</script>
```
- The `<script>` section contains the component's logic
- `lang="ts"` indicates this is a TypeScript file
- `export default` exports the component definition
- `name: 'App'` gives the component a name for debugging purposes

## Component Structure

### Single File Component (SFC)
- `.vue` files are called Single File Components
- They combine three sections:
  1. `<template>` - HTML structure
  2. `<script>` - JavaScript/TypeScript logic
  3. `<style>` - CSS styles (not present in this component)

### Component Hierarchy
- This is the root component
- Other components would be imported and used within this component
- Forms the top of your application's component tree

## How This Fits in the Application

1. Server-Side Rendering:
   - `entry-server.ts` uses this component to generate initial HTML
   - The template is rendered to a string
   - Sent to the browser as complete HTML

2. Client-Side:
   - `main.ts` mounts this component to the DOM
   - The component becomes interactive
   - Can handle user interactions and state changes

## Key Concepts

### Vue Component Structure
- Components are reusable pieces of UI
- Can contain:
  - Template (HTML)
  - Script (Logic)
  - Style (CSS)
  - Props (Input)
  - Events (Output)
  - State (Data)

### TypeScript Integration
- The `lang="ts"` attribute enables TypeScript support
- Provides type checking and better IDE support
- Makes the code more maintainable and less prone to errors

## Next Steps
To expand this application, you might want to:
1. Add more components
2. Implement routing
3. Add state management
4. Include styles
5. Add more interactive features
